## 1. Introduction
     
   Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of the gases that have direct imapcts on climate change. These seven gases are :
   carbon dioxide(CO2), methane(CH4), nitrous oxide(N20), chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), hydroflourocarbons(HFCs), perflurocarbons(PFCs)
   superhexaflouride(SF6), nitrogen triflouride(NF3)
   The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct 
   emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency.
   Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in thousand tonnes, tonnes per capita or kilogrammes per capita except for 
   CO2, which is measured in million tonnes and tonnes per capita.

## 2. Draft Research Questions
  1. We assume that the greenhouse gases amount in the atmosphere is increasing each year.
  2. Considering the amount of GHG emission in data set, we assume that USA, Great Britain , Canada are countries which are more prone        climate change.
  3. We assume that GDP and population are directly proportional to GHG emission.
  4. We assume that the highest amount of NOX and SOX gases are emitted from OECD countries.
  5. According to the values in the dataset, we assume that urbanization can be one of the reasons for amount of GHG emission.
