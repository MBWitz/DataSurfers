We will supplement this data with a table of urbanization by per cent of population from World Bank. This table consists of  265 rows and 54 columns. Each row represents a country or a summary for a geographic region. Columns represent the series name and code, the country name and code, and the percent of population living in urban areas for each year from 1967 through 2016.

Our analysis will attempt to answer the following questions:
1. Which countries and regions contribute the most CO2 emissions, both on a total volume basis and from a per capita perspective? Do the top offenders have similar patterns of increasing and decreasing emissions?   
2.
